                <p>"FlowBite provides a robust set of design tokens and components <br> based on the popular Tailwind CSS framework.</p>
                <p>From the most used UI components like forms and navigation <br> bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and <br> mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project.</p>
                <p>Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated <br> to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!"</p>

                <p>Everything is so well structured and simple to use (I've learnt so <br> much about Figma by just using the toolkit). Aesthetically, the <br> well designed components are beautiful and will undoubtedly <br> level up your next application."</p>

                <p>"I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm <br> speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my <br> application. Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and <br> near impossible to theme.</p>
                <p>Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it <br> took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and <br> integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.</p> 
                <p>If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this."</p>
